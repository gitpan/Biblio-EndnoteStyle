Revision history for Perl extension Biblio::EndnoteStyle.

0.02  Fri Feb 16 01:16:32 GMT 2007
	- Properly implement non-breaking space "Â¬", which was
	  previously rendered as a literal.
	- Add debug() method to the formatter, causing compiled
	  templates to be dumped to standard error.
	- Add command-line script "bin/endnote-format", to allow the
	  library to be simply exercised.
	- Improvements to documentation.

	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-X --name=Biblio::EndnoteStyle --compat-version=5.6.0 --omit-constant --skip-exporter --skip-ppport
	- This release is functional but incomplete: many, many more
	  test cases are needed, and adding these will no doubt
	  require fixes to the code.  Nevertheless, the module is
	  useful as it stands.
